# DayZ_Tool

All in one DayZ server modding tool

## Overview

This tool contains multiple programs to help DayZ server owners customize their servers.
Currently implemented:

1. Loadout Spawn Editor
2. Weather Configurator

### Loadout Spawn Editor

                                Features and Limitations

This spawn editor was created to expedite the creation of .json for spawnGearPresetFiles. There is currently
minimal validation for equipment restrictions. So yes if you put a 75 round drum mag on your Tundra, your file
will not work.
