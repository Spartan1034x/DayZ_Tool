Mr. Spartan the new exotic sniper dropped and it's not in your program !! Yes I know I can't keep up with all the updates,
but good news you can! If there is ever a new update and you want to add the new items to the program it is very easy.

Step 1 - Ensure the item you are adding is the proper code name eg. if you want to add the Tundra make sure its the code 
         name which is winchestor70.
		 
Step 2 - Ensure the item you are adding goes in the proper slot. The .txt files are all named with the slots they populate.
         For example InventoryItems.txt is your inventory slot, Hands.txt is your glove slot, etc..(Do NOT change file names!)

Step 3 - Add the new item code name to the bottom of the list, each item you add must go on a new line like so, 

... (previous items)
Bandana_Redpattern
FaceCover_Improvised
NioshFaceMask
NewItem1
NewItem2
NewItem3

*Note: The program will trim whitepace so entering this " NewItem1", "NewItem1 ", or "NewItem1" are all acceptable.

*Note2: Very important! The top of all the .txt files have an empty line for line 1 DO NOT DELETE or enter any characters!!

Happy modding! And as always you need any help drop me a line on youtube.
